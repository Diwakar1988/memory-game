The game starts initially with all cards facing down. The player is to then flip two cards each round, trying to find a match. If the flipped pair is a match, the player receives two (2) points, and the cards may be removed from the game board. Otherwise, the cards are turned faceÂ­ down again and the player loses one (1) point. This continues until all pairs have been found.
